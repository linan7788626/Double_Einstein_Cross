# Todo List of Simulated Double Einstein Crosses

## Lens
- [x] SIE mass model, SV, Phi, Ellipticity, Z_l.
- [ ] The images of the lens galaxy, Sersic or de V model.
- [ ] The right magnitude of the image. Chromatic images?

## Source
- [ ] Redshifts of both sources, Z_s1, Z_s2.
- [ ] Magnitudes of both sources.
- [ ] Positions of all the lensed images.
- [ ] Basic Lens modeling to produce realistic image.

## PSF and Noise
- [ ] Realistic PSF for this system.
- [ ] Realistic Noise for this system.
- [ ] Realistic SED, or colors of this system?

## Lens Modeling + Time Delay
- [ ] Lenstool.
- [ ] Gravlens.
- [ ] Suyuâ€™s Pipeline.
